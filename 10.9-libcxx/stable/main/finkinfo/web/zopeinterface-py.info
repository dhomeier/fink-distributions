Version: 4.5.0
Revision: 1
Description: Interface distribution from Zope 3
DescDetail: <<
This is a separate distribution of the zope.interface package
used in Zope 3, along with the packages it depends on.
This package is intended to be independently reusable in any Python project.
It is maintained by the Zope Toolkit project.
This package provides an implementation of "object interfaces" for Python.
Interfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a given API
or contract. So, this package can be considered as implementation of the
Design By Contract methodology support in Python.
