Description: Converting between Julian and calendar dates
DescDetail: <<
 Julian dates from proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars.
 This Python module contains functions for converting between Julian
 dates and calendar dates.
 A function for converting Gregorian calendar dates to Julian dates,
 and another function for converting Julian calendar dates to Julian
 dates are defined. Two functions for the reverse calculations are
 also defined.
 Different regions of the world switched to Gregorian calendar from
 Julian calendar on different dates. Having separate functions for
 Julian and Gregorian calendars allow maximum flexibility in choosing
 the relevant calendar
