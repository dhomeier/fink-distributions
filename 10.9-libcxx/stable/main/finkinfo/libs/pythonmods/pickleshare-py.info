Description: Shelve-like database with concurrency

DescDetail: <<
Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal
dictionary. Unlike shelve, many processes can access the database
simultaneously. Changing a value in database is immediately visible to
other processes accessing the same database.
