Package: send2trash-py%type_pkg[python]
Version: 1.5.0
Revision: 1
Type: python (2.7 3.4 3.5 3.6)

Description: Send file to trash natively under MacOS X
DescDetail: <<
Send2Trash is a small package that sends files to the Trash (or Recycle Bin)
natively and on all platforms. On OS X, it uses native FSMoveObjectToTrashSync
Cocoa calls, on Windows, it uses native (and ugly) SHFileOperation win32 calls.
On other platforms, if PyGObject and GIO are available, it will use this.
Otherwise, it will fallback to its own implementation of the trash
specifications from freedesktop.org.
<<
DescPort: <<
``ctypes`` is used to access native libraries, so no compilation is necessary;
pytest implemented, but no actual tests present.
