Description: Better directory iterator and faster os.walk()
DescDetail: <<
scandir() is a directory iteration function like os.listdir(), except that
instead of returning a list of bare filenames, it yields DirEntry objects
that include file type and stat information along with the name.
Using scandir() increases the speed of os.walk() by 2-20 times (depending
on the platform and file system) by avoiding unnecessary calls to os.stat()
in most cases.
scandir has been included in the Python 3.5 standard library as os.scandir(),
and the related performance improvements to os.walk() have also been included.
